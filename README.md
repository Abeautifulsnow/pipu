# pkgu

Find the out-dated packages installed by the Pip tool and update them.

## Usage

First, you need to install dependencies.

if you don't have `poetry` tool, please install it first. ðŸ”—: [poetry installation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation), otherwise, install packages directly.

```bash
poetry install
```

and then, run `main.py` script.

```bash
python3 pipu.py
```

## ScreenShoot

* No packages need to be upgraded.

* Upgrade some expired packages.

* Update the pkg synchronously

* Update the pkg asynchronously

We can see that the async method is faster than sync method about 9 seconds(Only in this test situation).
So now it can support to update the python libraries asynchronously. ðŸ¥³

# pkgu

Find the out-dated packages installed by the Pip tool and update them. Inspired by ðŸ‘‰[depu](https://github.com/kevwan/depu)

## Usage

- Run code from source code

First, you need to install dependencies.

if you don't have `poetry` tool, please install it first. ðŸ”—: [poetry installation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation), otherwise, install packages directly.

```bash
poetry install
```

and then, run `pkgu.py` script.

```bash
python3 pkgu.py
```

- Use it through pip

```bash
pip3 install pkgu
```

after the installation is complete, you can enter `pkgu -h` command on your terminal to learn how to use it.

> 3. Update the pkg synchronously

> 4. Update the pkg asynchronously

We can see that the async method is faster than sync method about 9 seconds(Only in this test situation).
So now it can support to update the python libraries asynchronously. ðŸ¥³

# pkgu

Find the out-dated packages installed by the Pip tool and update them. Inspired by ðŸ‘‰[depu(Go)](https://github.com/kevwan/depu).
However, `pkgu` supports full and partial updates, which is more convenient and flexible. It also supports cross-platform(Windows, linux, macos). ðŸ¤“ To retrieve the data more fast after the first-time(Or don't have to execute command again), I use sqlite as cache db to store the data and can quickly read it from db and present it to the consoleðŸ’».

ðŸ‘‰ However, only python3.10 and above are available now.

## Usage

- Run code from source code

First, you need to install dependencies.

if you don't have `poetry` tool, please install it first. ðŸ”—: [poetry installation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation), otherwise, install packages directly.

```bash
poetry install
```

and then, run `pkgu.py` script.

```bash
python3 pkgu.py
```

- Use it through pip - ***Highly Recommended***

```bash
pip3 install pkgu
```

after the installation is complete, `pkgu` executable file will be written to the python bin directory and you can enter `pkgu -h` command on your terminal to learn how to use it.

## ScreenShoot

> 1. No packages need to be upgraded.

> 2. Upgrade some expired packages.

> 3. Update the pkg synchronously

> 4. Update the pkg asynchronously

![img_5.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abeautifulsnow/pkgu/main/screenshoot/img_5.png)

We can see that the async method is faster than sync method about 9 seconds(Only in this test situation).
So now it can support to update the python libraries asynchronously. ðŸ¥³

> 5. Support for selectable update packages

* List all availbable packages

* Select ths part of package to be updated

> 6. !!!New - Support to use cache result from sqlite db file.

This improve the expirence that how we list the out-dated packages when they are huge to collect, and then there also is a cli flag `--no-cache` to control whether should to use cache.
